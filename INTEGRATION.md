# PrivatePredictionMarket Integration - Complete

## Summary

Successfully integrated the **PrivatePredictionMarket** contract with the frontend on **Base Sepolia (chainId 84532)**.

## Deployed Contract

- **Address**: `0x6b8f5826Ff8C03C597482483EC1f7E60a5Fda5A7`
- **Network**: Base Sepolia
- **Explorer**: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x6b8f5826Ff8C03C597482483EC1f7E60a5Fda5A7

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
✅ **Create Market** - Modal with description and duration inputs (commit + reveal windows)
✅ **Commit Vote** - Private vote commitment with auto-generated salt (stored locally)
✅ **Reveal Vote** - Reveal with auto-loaded salt or manual entry (advanced mode)
✅ **Manual Transitions** - "Nudge to Reveal" and "Nudge to Resolved" buttons for creators
✅ **Resolve Market** - Creator-only YES/NO outcome resolution
✅ **Creator Panel** - Private stats dashboard (vote counts, revealed votes list)

### UI Components

1. **[PPMMarketCard.tsx](frontend/src/components/market/PPMMarketCard.tsx)** - Market cards with phase badges and CTAs
2. **[TradeTicket.tsx](frontend/src/components/trade/TradeTicket.tsx)** - Commit/Reveal modal with salt management
3. **[CreateMarketModal.tsx](frontend/src/components/market/CreateMarketModal.tsx)** - Market creation form
4. **[CreatorPanel.tsx](frontend/src/components/market/CreatorPanel.tsx)** - Private creator dashboard
5. **[ToastContainer.tsx](frontend/src/components/ui/ToastContainer.tsx)** - Toast notifications

### State Management

- **[store.ts](frontend/src/lib/store.ts)** - Zustand store for UI state (modals, toasts, pending tx)
- **[ppmClient.ts](frontend/src/lib/ppmClient.ts)** - Contract interaction wrapper
- **[salt.ts](frontend/src/lib/salt.ts)** - LocalStorage-based salt persistence
- **[hooks/useMarkets.ts](frontend/src/lib/hooks/useMarkets.ts)** - React Query hooks for markets
- **[hooks/useUserStatus.ts](frontend/src/lib/hooks/useUserStatus.ts)** - User commit/reveal status

### Market Lifecycle Flow

```
Create → Commit Phase → Reveal Phase → Resolved
         (countdown)    (countdown)     (outcome)
              ↓              ↓              ↓
         Commit YES/NO   Reveal Vote   View Result
         (salt saved)    (validate)    (YES/NO)
```

### Privacy Features

- **Commit Phase**: Votes are hashed with 32-byte random salt (client-side)
- **Salt Storage**: Stored in localStorage per wallet+market (`ppm:84532:0x...:{wallet}:{marketId}`)
- **Reveal Phase**: Salt auto-loaded for one-click reveal
- **Creator Privacy**: Only creator can see vote counts and revealed voter list
- **Error Handling**: `OnlyCreator` errors surface permission messages

### Phase-Based UX

| Phase | Actions | Constraints |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Commit** | Commit YES/NO | Before `commitEndTime`, not already committed |
| **Reveal** | Reveal vote | Before `revealEndTime`, must have committed, not already revealed |
| **Resolved** | View outcome | Market must be in Resolved state and resolved by creator |

### Manual Transitions

- **Nudge to Reveal**: Available when `now >= commitEndTime` and `state == Commit`
- **Nudge to Resolved**: Available when `now >= revealEndTime` and `state == Reveal`
- Error messages: `CommitPhaseNotEnded`, `RevealPhaseNotEnded`

### Creator-Only Features

1. **Vote Counts**: Live YES/NO tallies (creator panel)
2. **Revealed Votes List**: Table of voter addresses, votes, timestamps
3. **Manual Transitions**: Buttons to advance market state
4. **Resolve Outcome**: YES/NO picker to finalize result

### Error Mapping

All contract errors mapped to friendly messages:

- `InvalidTimeParameters` → "Durations must be > 0."
- `AlreadyCommitted` → "You already committed."
- `InvalidReveal` → "Vote or salt doesn't match your commitment."
- `OnlyCreator` → "Only the market creator can view or perform this action."
- `MarketNotInCommitPhase` → "Action not allowed in this phase."
- (and 7 more...)

## Environment Setup

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://sepolia.base.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
NEXT_PUBLIC_PPM_ADDRESS=0x6b8f5826Ff8C03C597482483EC1f7E60a5Fda5A7
```

## Running the App

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Testing the Flow

1. **Connect Wallet** (MetaMask or WalletConnect to Base Sepolia)
2. **Create Market**: Click "Create Market" → Enter description and durations (e.g., 300s each)
3. **Commit Vote**: Click "Commit YES" or "Commit NO" → Vote saved with random salt
4. **Wait or Transition**: After commit window, click "Move to Reveal" (if creator)
5. **Reveal Vote**: Click "Reveal Vote" → Salt auto-loaded, vote revealed
6. **Wait or Transition**: After reveal window, click "Move to Resolved" (if creator)
7. **Resolve Market**: Select YES or NO outcome → Market finalized
8. **View Creator Panel**: See private vote counts and revealed list (creator only)

## Technical Stack

- **Smart Contract**: Solidity 0.8.13 (Foundry)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Web3**: Wagmi 2.x, Viem 2.x, TanStack Query 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (existing design tokens)
- **State**: Zustand (UI), React Query (async)

## Files Added/Modified

### Added (14 files)
- `frontend/.env.local`
- `frontend/src/lib/contract.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/wagmi.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/ppmClient.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/salt.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/time.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/hooks/useMarkets.ts`

- `frontend/src/components/market/PPMMarketCard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/market/PPMMarketList.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/market/CreateMarketModal.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/market/CreatorPanel.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/ToastContainer.tsx`

### Modified (5 files)
- `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Wagmi + Query providers
- `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Integrated live market list
- `frontend/src/components/header/Header.tsx` - Added "Create Market" button
- `frontend/src/components/trade/TradeTicket.tsx` - Complete commit/reveal rewrite
- `frontend/src/components/market/PricePill.tsx` - Made `cents` optional
- `frontend/src/lib/store.ts` - Extended with modals, toasts, pending tx

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

- [x] Market list renders from live chain, not mocks
- [x] Create market with valid durations
- [x] Commit YES/NO with saved salt
- [x] Manual transition to Reveal phase
- [x] Reveal with stored salt
- [x] Manual transition to Resolved
- [x] Resolve outcome (creator only)
- [x] Creator panel shows private counts and revealed list
- [x] Non-creator view is gated
- [x] All revert reasons produce clear toasts
- [x] No style drift (design tokens preserved)
- [x] Build succeeds with no errors

## Notes

- **Salt Management**: 32-byte salts generated client-side, never sent to chain until reveal
- **Privacy**: Only creator can access `getVoteCounts` and `getRevealedVotes`
- **Manual Transitions**: Anyone can call transition functions, but only when time windows end
- **Resolve**: Only creator can set final outcome after reveal phase
- **Polling**: Markets refetch every 10s, individual market every 5s
- **Optimistic Updates**: Query cache invalidated on all write operations

**Status**: ✅ Integration Complete - Ready for Testing
